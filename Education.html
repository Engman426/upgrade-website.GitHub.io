		<h1>WHAT IS TECHNOLOGY?</h1>
	</header>
	
	<main>
		<p>Technology refers to the application of scientific knowledge and tools to solve practical problems, create new products or services, and improve existing ones. Technology can be found in almost every aspect of modern life, from communication to transportation, healthcare, entertainment, education, and more.
    </p>
    <h1>FACTS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY</h1>
    <ul>Technology is the development of systematic techniques for making and doing things, with a chronological approach tracing its development through phases. The standard method for surveying technological experience and innovations is based on general social conditions, dominant materials, and sociocultural consequences. Humans have the capacity to think systematically and creatively about techniques, allowing them to innovate and modify the environment in a way no other species has achieved.The transmission of technological innovations has traditionally been the movement of artifacts and craftsmen, with evidence from documentary matter and archaeological evidence. Historians must be prepared to use all sources and call upon specialists as appropriate.
    </ul>
